- Animation Suite: Included Static, Size Breathing, Rotating Spiral, and Color Spiral animation types for the aim interface.

## Changes & Improvements
- SDK Optimization: Switched actor scanning to ASBZCharacter for better performance and target acquisition.

- Enhanced Instant Interaction: Refined the interaction loop to exclude bag items, preventing accidental bag-teleporting bugs.

## Planned Features & Known Issues
- Aim FOV: Currently undergoing a full rewrite; logic is killing enemies outside the visual circle.
- Visibility Checks: Implementing ray-tracing to prevent locking onto enemies behind solid walls.
- Mute Guard Audio: Re-evaluating multiplayer sync for guard sound removal.

- Console Command Executor: Testing safety of internal engine command calls.

## Developer Notes
- Loader Location: The loader **must be placed inside its own folder**. Running it loose will cause paths to break and the loader will not function correctly.
