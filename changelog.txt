## Version 1.4.0 (Current Release)

## Major Aim System Overhau
- Target Persistence Fix: Optimized G::pSilentTarget handling to prevent "ghost locking" on invalid or dead actors.

## New Features
- Rapid Fire: Globally adjusted RoundsPerMinute for all ranged weapons.
- Triggerbot: Automatically fire at a valid target.

## Changes & Improvements
- SDK Optimization: Switched actor scanning to ASBZCharacter for better performance and target acquisition.
- Weapon Data Backup System: Implemented a map-based backup system for weapon stats, ensuring game stability when switching between different weapon types.
- Client Fly Zero Friction: Improved the "Client Move" logic to instantly stop velocity when movement keys are released.
- Enhanced Instant Interaction: Refined the interaction loop to exclude bag items, preventing accidental bag-teleporting bugs.

## Planned Features & Known Issues
- Aim FOV: Currently undergoing a full rewrite; logic is killing enemies outside the visual circle.
- Visibility Checks: Implementing ray-tracing to prevent locking onto enemies behind solid walls.
- Mute Guard Audio: Re-evaluating multiplayer sync for guard sound removal.
- Unlock All Weapon Parts: Fixing registry calls for part availability.
- Third Person / Camera Angle: Adjusting spring-arm offsets for better visibility.
- Console Command Executor: Testing safety of internal engine command calls.
- Instant Reload: Bypasses reload timers to instantly refill the current magazine.

## Developer Notes
- Loader Location: The loader **must be placed inside its own folder**. Running it loose will cause paths to break and the loader will not function correctly.
